# Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to foster a respectful, professional, and harassment-free environment within our community. Our commitment is to maintain a positive atmosphere for everyone, free from abuse or discrimination, and to encourage collaboration toward shared goals in the development of this project.

## Our Standards

To build a supportive community, we ask all participants to commit to:

- Showing respect and empathy toward other members
- Welcoming constructive feedback and differing viewpoints
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes and striving to learn from them
- Prioritising the interests of the community as a whole
- Fostering an open and productive environment for everyone

**Unacceptable behaviors include:**

- Insults, derogatory comments, or unwarranted personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing or sharing others' private information without consent
- Violations of project licenses or terms

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for enforcing these standards and may take appropriate action in response to behavior deemed inappropriate, unprofessional, or harmful. This may include removing comments, commits, and other contributions that conflict with this Code of Conduct. Leaders will provide reasons for any moderation actions as appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the project, including official online forums, social media, and events. It also applies to individuals representing the project in public spaces, such as using an official email address or participating in discussions on behalf of the project. If this will ever happen...

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported to project leaders. All reports will be reviewed promptly, and privacy and confidentiality of the reporter will be respected.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Our project uses the following levels of response for handling unacceptable behavior:

1. **Correction**  
   **Impact**: Minor, isolated incidents, such as some abusive language.  
   **Consequence**: A private warning from project leaders, clarifying the issue and its impact. A public apology may be requested.

2. **Warning**  
   **Impact**: A more severe violation or repeated behavior.  
   **Consequence**: A formal warning with a specified period of non-engagement with affected parties. Continued violations may lead to a temporary ban.

3. **Temporary Ban**  
   **Impact**: Serious violations or sustained inappropriate behavior.  
   **Consequence**: A temporary ban from interactions within the project community. Further violations may result in a permanent ban.

4. **Permanent Ban**
